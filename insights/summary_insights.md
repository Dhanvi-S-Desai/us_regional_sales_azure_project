# Executive Insight Summary

This analysis identifies procurement delays and discounting practices as the
primary drivers of inefficiency and margin leakage.

Key conclusions:
- End-to-end supply chain delays originate upstream in procurement, not delivery.
- Inventory planning is challenged by demand volatility and fragmented purchasing.
- Discounting erodes margins materially across all warehouses.
- Profitability is driven by high-volume channels, not highest margin rates.

Recommended focus areas:
1. Supplier and procurement cycle optimization
2. Reorder policy redesign for volatile SKUs
3. Discount governance aligned with inventory and demand signals
